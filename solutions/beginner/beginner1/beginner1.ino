// This is a comment. The program won't look at it

// the setup method runs once before the start of the loop
void setup() 
{
	Serial.begin(9600); // this tells arduino that we are going to print characters
	Serial.println("Hello World"); // [blank] what should go inside the parenthesis?
}

// the code in here runs forever until the power to the arduino is disconnected
void loop() 
{

}
