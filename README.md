# camp2019

## TODO
- [ ] Work out pin mapping and schematics for each activity (similar to the way arduino ide has the schematics in their example code folders)
- [ ] Make sure PWM pins are used where PWM is required


## About
This repository contains everything you need to get started with the camp.
Make sure you have setup your Arduino IDE first.


## Instructions
The activities can be found in the `activities` folder.
Start here, and try to fill in the blanks into the code.

If you need any help, ask a friend or volunteer. 
If you are still stuck, or simply wish to move on, you can view the solution in the solutions folder.
